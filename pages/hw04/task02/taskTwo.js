// Assume that the board comes in the form of a 3x3 array, where the value is 0 if a spot is empty, 1 if it is an "X", or 2 if it is an "O", like so:
// [[0, 0, 1],
//  [0, 1, 2],
//  [2, 1, 0]]
// We want our function to return:
// -1 if the board is not yet finished (there are empty spots),
// 1 if "X" won,
// 2 if "O" won,
// 0 if it's a cat's game (i.e. a draw).
// You may assume that the board passed in is valid in the context of a game of Tic-Tac-Toe.
